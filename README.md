# Ray Tracer Challenge in Rust

## Overview

This repository is a work-in-progress implementation of "The Ray Tracer Challenge" by Jamis Buck, undertaken as a learning project for the Rust programming language.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are:

1. **Learning Rust:** Gain proficiency in the Rust programming language by applying its principles and best practices in a real-world project.

2. **Understanding Ray Tracing:** Deepen understanding of ray tracing techniques and computer graphics through hands-on implementation.

3. **Code Quality:** Strive for clean, idiomatic, and efficient Rust code, following established coding conventions and design patterns.
